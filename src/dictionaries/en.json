				"description": "After graduating from Lighthouse Labs in April 2020, I landed a job at Webisoft, a small web agency startup based in Montréal. I was tasked to maintain, and build all of their React.js applications, which involved working on a long-standing app, an app which was just about ready to launch, and a new app in its infancy. The small size of the company and the different scopes for each project meant I had to learn how to adapt to a new environment quickly and independently.",

I worked on various projects, learning new technologies along the way such as Vue.js, TypeScript, and very briefly C# / ASP.NET Core. While there, I had many opportunities to pair program with experienced, senior developers who taught me valuable skills when it comes to teamwork in software development.",

				"description": "I was recruited at the beginning of 2022 to work for Nurun, a veteran web agency which has a ton of projects from a wide range of industries around the world. I worked for impressive clients such as Hydro-Québec, Cadillac, Grant Thornton, and ADMTL just to name a few. I had to adapt to new technologies, projects, and teams quickly as I was needed to jump from one project to another, while still having to maintain the highest possible code quality. While still doing the majority of my work in React.js and TypeScript, I had to learn technologies on the fly such as: GraphQL, Strapi, Storybook, CraftCMS, Stencil, and Twig just to name a few. Their emphasis on accessibility had me work closely with a WCAG expert, making sure that applications met WCAG 2.0 accessibility standards.",

As an independent dev, I have been putting my skills to the test while working on and contributing to a couple of projects such as Rue Dorion, TimeStep, MontrealSwingCalendar, Campus Balboa, and MTL BAL JAM. I have been using technologies such as Next.js and Gatsby.js for static website generation, coupled with Contentful as a headless CMS. For web applications with a dedicated backend, I have collaborated with an AWS engineer using Node.js, AppSync, Amplify, and Cognito, in GraphQL. My focus has been learning as much as I can while working on these projects, making sure to keep up with current techs and taking Udemy courses on the side.",
